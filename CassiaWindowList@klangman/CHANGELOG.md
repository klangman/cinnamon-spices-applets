# Changelog

## 2.0.0

* Added 9 mouse button actions for window tiling
* Added mouse button action to move a window to the current workspace
* Fixed several cases where the icon saturation effect was not changing to reflect a change in a window state
* Changed icon saturation effect for grouped window list buttons to only consider the last-focused window rather then requiring all window to have the same qualifying state before using the effect
* Changed how the applet was deciding on code paths for features that are only possible in newer releases. This fixes some issues when running on Cinnamon 5.x releases prior to 5.4.
* Added version numbering, started with version 2.0 based on the fact that I have already far exceeded the feature set that I originally set out to implement.
* Added a CHANGELOG.md file (you're looking at it now)

## 1.0.0+

* There was no version tracking prior to version 2.0.0
