Immediately suspends the computer (by default)

## Features

1. Suspend instantly on a single click or only suspend on a double-click to avoid accidentally suspending the computer.
2. Optionally add a count-down timer (1-9 sec) giving you the chance to cancel the suspend operation. 
3. A single click on the panel button during the count down will cancel the suspend operation.
4. Choose between a full color or a symbolic panel icon for the applet.
